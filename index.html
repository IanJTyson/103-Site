    <h1>Readings:</h1>
  Reading 1
Part 1:
Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?
A system is an interconnected relationship where each of its parts contribute to the greater whole. A system is NOT where there is no correlation between any of the members or aspects.

Q2. -- For the 4 system definitions you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.
Modularity: how well chunks of a system can be rearranged yet still function properly

Decomposability: disintegrating a system into its individual parts

Emergence: the idea that something has traits that its individual parts do not have

Chaos Theory: the initial conditions of something can be highly influential to what happens; nothing will ever be exactly the same twice.

Q3 -- Give us your definition of what Tessellation means and give an example you encountered, not mentioned in the reading.
A repetition or pattern of something. Typically in art it consists of a repeated shape(s) over a surface with some organized form. Sacred Geometry i.e. “the flower of life” is an example.

Q4 -- What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in opposition with each other?
Tesselation is the same “module” repeated over an area, where as Modularity is how you can move a segment of parts from the whole and they remain function as you move them to another area of the system.

Q5 -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)
Complexity brings the challenge of not including too much exact repetition as seen in uniform designs.

Reading 2:
Q1. What are the differences between site specific art work and the idea of art interventions.

Art interventions play off existing signage/ site specific artworks (i.e. billboards) to send a message or commentate on that existing sign. Site Specific art rather, uses an area and builds upon it in a different capacity. 

Q2. What are the similarities and differences regarding the art work of Robert Irwin, Walter De Maria, Banksy, and Robert Mongomery?

Each use the location for their pieces as the focus of the concept, but have differing approaches.

Q3. What are the main characteristics that separate something being any kind of art versus what all signs must share to be relevant or meaningful? This means ALL signs, from art signs to traffic signs, to signs even in our home.

All signs are site specific or they have no use.  It is always meant to give information about that specific place or it is not deemed a "sign".

Q4. What Kind of art, (not shown here), have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate on its description and provide images if possible.

Reuben Wu, he uses Drone Lighting and photo composition to create images and videos illuminating natural landscapes. This creates an otherworldly feeling in his work... evoking the ideas of space travel and science fiction.


Reading 3:
Q1. From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinoasaurs really look like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this effect our understanding of what Archeology is saying about them.

We originally viewed dinosaurs as sad gray reptile creatures which were destined to be extinct. As time went on, our technology got better and so did our vision of what these creatures looked like.  Now we see them as brightly colored with feathers and featuring a connection to birds and their intelligence. This change in aesthetics also came with our emotional reflection of them. Early drawings of dinosaurs were desolate - because the artists drawing them assumed they were dumb creatures. Now, we see images of them that are much more sophisticated to match our understanding of what these creatures were.

Q2. The artist/archcologist John Conway who is doing interpretaions of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other fields of science, creative based disciplines and forms of studies use similer techniques that reminds you of this method or process. Please elaborate with your examples both written as well as images and links.

Astronomy and space exploration are the first to come to mind. We are limited in our scope of the greater universe because of our technology, so we often create visuals to show and describe aspects we cannot actually see yet. Another field of science may be deep sea exploration. This is similar to outer space in a way because technology as of now isn't capable of diving to the ultimate depths of Earth. Here is an example of some creatures we may previously have thought too extraordinary to exist:

Q3. First, summerize in your own words the characteristics of 'Material Speculation' as described in the second article. Then given this article's examples for possible future products, how can this same technique also be used to create objects that refer to the past?

Material Speculation is the way an object and it's characteristics relate to the world and context they are placed in (whether real or imagined). For objects referring to the past, we may see them created from stone - a material that lives on past the creators for millennia. This idea is often used in theories relating to ancient technologies, as their artifacts are made of stone which will never decay unlike thatch, wood, etc.

Q4. What are the 4 most common kinds of artifacts listed in the readings. As these are broad catagories can you list, some more specific ones?, They may be either a part of these catagories as a subtopic or maybe not under these classications at all. List 4 more catagories and give examples.

Historical and Culture, Media, Knowledge, and Data. Some other categories within these could be: Art, Tools, Texts, and Natural. Art refers to statues, decorative urns and such. Tools are anything anthropologic where there was an intended use which humans had for the object. Texts are in reference to records where they account the life of the past through written or visual language. Finally, Natural speaks on human, plant, or animal where we can learn about the past through studying them.
